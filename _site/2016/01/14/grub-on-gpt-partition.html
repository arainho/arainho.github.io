<h1 id="grub-on-gpt-partitions">GRUB on GPT Partitions</h1>

<p>GPT partition tables do not have the limit of 4 primary partitions (unlike MBR) but requires an additional (small) partition to be able to boot from GNU GRUB. 
Use mktable gpt to initialize a disk with a GPT partition table:</p>

<pre>
(parted) mktable gpt
</pre>

<p>3 partitions are at least required to use GPT: 
1 small partition (1MB) with no filesystem at the first 2GB of the disk with toggle bios_grub used for booting, 
and 2 more for the rootfs and swap, i.e:</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t have this 1MB partition you get this</p>
<pre>
~# grub-install /dev/sdb

Installing for i386-pc platform.
grub-install: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be p
ossible.
grub-install: warning: Embedding is not possible.  GRUB can only be installed in this setup by using 
blocklists.  However, blocklists are UNRELIABLE and their use is discouraged..
grub-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists.
</pre>

<p>Create partitions</p>
<pre>
parted&gt; mkpart primary ext2 1 2
parted&gt; set 1 bios_grub on
parted&gt; mkpart primary linux-swap 2 32G
parted&gt; mkpart primary ext4 32G 100%
parted&gt; quit
</pre>

<p>List partitions</p>
<pre>
(parted) p
Model: HP LOGICAL VOLUME (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdb: 1000GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt

 3      32.0GB  1000GB  968GB                primary
</pre>

<p>After this you can install GRUB with success</p>
<pre>
~# grub-install /dev/sdb

Installing for i386-pc platform.
Installation finished. No error reported

DROWN shows that merely supporting SSLv2 is a threat to modern servers and clients. 
It allows an attacker to decrypt modern TLS connections between up-to-date clients and servers by sending probes to a server that supports SSLv2 and uses the same private key.

DROWN is made worse by two additional OpenSSL implementation vulnerabilities. CVE-2015-3197, which affected OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.2f and 1.0.1r, allows a DROWN attacker to connect to the server with disabled SSLv2 ciphersuites, provided that support for SSLv2 itself is enabled. CVE-2016-0703, which affected OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r, and 0.9.8zf, greatly reduces the time and cost of carrying out the DROWN attack.

Let's update openssl on all servers with Ansible

    ~$ cat openssl.yml
    
        ---
        # Patches openssl problem and restarts needed services
        - name: Apply common configration to all nodes
          hosts: all
          # Uncomment to apply update one server at a time
          # serial: 1
          tasks:
        
            - name: "Install packages and update cache"
              apt: pkg="{{ item }}" state=latest update_cache=yes
              with_items:
                - openssl
          
            - name: "Restart Services known to be affected"
              service: name={{ item }} state=restarted
              with_items:
                - ssh
                - nginx
                - whoopsie
                - snmpd
                - ntp
                - supervisor
                - postfix
                - dovecot
                - apache
                - shibd
              ignore_errors: yes
        
            - name: "Check that we are safe"
              shell: >
                if [ "$(openssl version -a | grep built)" != "built on: Mon Apr  7 20:33:29 UTC 2014" ]; then echo "Bad build date"; echo "$(openssl version -a | grep built)"; exit 1; fi
              tags: check
        
            - name: "Check that we don't have affected processes running"
              shell: >
                if [ "$(sudo lsof -n | grep ssl | grep DEL | wc -l)" != "0" ]; then echo "We still have affected processes"; checkrestart; exit 1; fi
              tags: check
        

    ~$ ansible-playbook -i ansible_hosts openssl.yml


For Dovecot we need to disable SSLv2, i found the solution on [hackernewsmobile].

    ~# vi /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf

            ssl_cipher_list = ALL:!ADH:!LOW:!SSLv2:!SSLv3:!EXP:!aNULL:!RC4:+HIGH:+MEDIUM


After that restart Dovecot:

    ~# service dovecot stop
    ~# service dovecot start


On Apache you should also disable SSLv2 and add this lines to your vhosts files, 
after the _<VirtualHost *:443>_ line.

    ~ # vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/mycompany-ssl 

        SSLEngine On
        SSLOptions +StrictRequire
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/private/mycompany.com.pem
        SSLProtocol ALL +TLSv1 -SSLv2 -SSLv3
        SSLHonorCipherOrder on
        # Prefer PFS, allow TLS, avoid SSL, for IE8 on XP still allow 3DES
        SSLCipherSuite "EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384 EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+SHA384 EECDH+aRSA+SHA256 EECDH+AESGCM EECDH EDH+AESGCM EDH+aRSA HIGH !MEDIUM !LOW !aNULL !eNULL !LOW !RC4 !MD5 !EXP !PSK !SRP !DSS


And after this restart your Apache Server:

    ~# service apache2 stop
    ~# service apache2 start


Get Code from project [public_drown_scanner] on github, and install dependencies.

    ~$ git clone https://github.com/nimia/public_drown_scanner
    ~$ cd public_drown_scanner
    ~$ pip2 install enum pycrypto scapy pyasn1 scapy-ssl_tls --user
 

Now check if you are vulnerable with this:

    ~$ python2 scanner.py my-mailserver.com 993
    ~$ python2 scanner.py my-webserver.com 443

Also We can use are _openssl_ to check:

    ~$ openssl s_client -ssl2 -connect my-mailserver.com 993
    ~$ openssl s_client -ssl2 -connect my-webserver.com:443
    
Or use _nmap_ to enumerate available cyphers:

    ~$ nmap -Pn --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 993 my-mailserver.com
    ~$ nmap -Pn --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 my-webserver.com


After this go [drownattack] website and test your Servers ( mail, web, etc)

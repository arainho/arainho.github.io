### talk - Secure development with git

I did a talk & demo called "Secure development with git" last Wednesday 25th May, on the [UA CyberSecWeek '22](https://cybersecweek.ua.pt/program.html), that toke place on [DETI](https://www.ua.pt/deti/), University of Aveiro.

I created a GitHub repository called [secure-git-workshop](https://github.com/arainho/secure-git-workshop) to support the talk.
The repo has several branches, each with a distinct challenge, and you can check the several steps in the workshop diagram [[+]](https://github.com/arainho/secure-git-workshop/blob/main/workshop_steps.png).

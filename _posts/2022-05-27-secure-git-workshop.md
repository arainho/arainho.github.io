### talk - Secure development with git

I did a talk & demo called "Secure development with git" last Wednesday 25th May, on the UA CyberSecWeek '22, that toke place on DETI, University of Aveiro.

I created a GitHub repository called secure-git-workshop to support the talk.
The repo has several branches, each with a distinct challenge, and you can check the several steps in the workshop diagram [+].

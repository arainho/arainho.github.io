[API Security Toolbox](https://github.com/arainho/apisec-toolbox) born in October 2021 !

I started a repository dedicated to experimenting around automatic and manual flows related to security testing for APIs.
API Security Toolbox (aka apisec-toolbox) is a Swiss knife for API security testing including a docker image, some labs and resources.

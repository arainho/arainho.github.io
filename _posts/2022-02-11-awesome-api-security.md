[awesome-api-security](https://github.com/arainho/awesome-api-security), a collection of awesome API Security tools and resources reaches 1k stars :-D

I created a repository at GitHub related to API security in August 2020, it started as a personal list of bookmarks.
It evolved and I started to invest and learn more about the topic and add more resources to it.

In 2021 APIsecurity.io referenced my repo in a [newsletter](https://apisecurity.io/issue-162-compromised-googe-cloud-accounts-graphql-as-api-gateway-api-security-guide-and-training/), also on their [twitter](https://twitter.com/apisecurityio/status/1404423379197652993), the Bug Bounty Hunter in 2022 on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tbbhunter/status/1478750754844422144), and people started to add it to their favorites.
I ended up having 400 stars in December 2021, now I have 1k ;-)

Thank you all that found the `awesome-api-security` repo useful.
